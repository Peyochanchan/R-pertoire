RPertoire is a app giving access to a music program, a list for an event.
The user can post the songs that will be played and build a program with it.
He can order them the way he wants, translate them(name and description of the list – lyrics and title of the songs) in five languages(ar|en|es|fr|nb)
Finally when the program is built, he can give access via QRCode, and print a pdf with:\n
- The Name of the List (and a picture)\n
— The Songs with their own tonality\n
- The Description of the List (the event, the recommendations)
- The QRCode that the host can put at the entry of the event.

Next step is to give access to translations with a subscription | give free access without translations.
